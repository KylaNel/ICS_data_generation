# Where I am

* Learned roughly how smart grids work
* Learned which threats are common
	* Confidentiality attacks: FDI and spoofing
	* Integrity attacks: malicious control over voltage control
	* Availability attacks: ddos
* Found many examples of ML being used in these cases - both conventional ML and advanced deep learning
* I want to spend the next week deciding what threat or threats to create a detection algorithm for (based on data availability and my limited compute power)
* Also want to find the best training techniques for these particular threats

# Questions

* Where does the emphasis on privacy come in?
* Was thinking to structure the paper around one threat type and try different training methods to see which works best. Does that sound reasonable?
* Alternatively, find some way to combine data integrity and data confidentiality?

# Meeting Notes
Detection is important
think about signatures of attacks - what is generic across these attacks (what behaviour is symptomatic of different attack types)
how do attacks link with indicators of compromise (IoCs)
How to do initial mapping exercise - how to IoCs map to high-level attacks
diagnose attacks based on these 
create a little paper database
generate 2 or 3 questions
combine detection and diagnoses - how do attacks represent themselves within the underlying data
