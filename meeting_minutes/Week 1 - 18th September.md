## Project Background

Energy sources (solar, wind etc.) provide energy to the virtual [[Smart Grids]] connected by various and multiple IoT devices. [[Smart Grids]] feed into the energy market, which has **many** vendors and users. Small changes in info supplied to the [[Smart Grids]] result in big changes to the energy market.

## Project Aim

Develop (or repurpose) a ML algorithm to improve security (threat detection) in the [[Smart Grids]] while preserving user privacy.

Mathematically model threats and detection in the [[Smart Grids]] (stretch?)

## This Week

Requirements gathering: read a lot.
