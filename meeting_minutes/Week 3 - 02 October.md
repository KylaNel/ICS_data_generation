# Where I am
- Lots of reading particularly on FDI
- Found that most threat models made for smart grids use sensor data and not network packet data
- Found out there's a couple of open problems
	- Need for more interpretable methods
	- Contributions of different features to the detection performance

# Meeting notes

No fixed architecture???

Ask Scottish Power for network packet data and for architecture layout

Summarise existing studies and find what datasets used and available - are there any network datasets available

a couple of bullet points

rather than traditional ml algorithms - use more tricky algorithms - threat detection using self-learning with dual neural networks
(graph based approaches?? - modal nodes as devices (smart meters) - check if metrics change in one cluster of nodes)
recurrent graph based neural networks
statistical approaches

large language models? - feature engineering to make it work

confluence for meeting notes?
