## Where I am

- read and summarised a lot 
	- found lots of big reviews that collate studies and datasets they used
- contacted ScottishPower (email and form) - no response yet
- haven't found any network data - where network data is used it usually doesn't even come from smart grids (often data from military exercises or competitions)
- Some options:
	- apply some really fancy ML to network data
	- integrate multiple GNNs such as GCNs and GRNN on simulated network data and hope we get data from ScottishPower in the mean time


Reinforcement learning can bypass detection problem - model to understand system behaviour and mitigate attacks

Try and include reinforcement learning in table of resources

How does GNN have oversight of communications? Compare different GNNs in terms of computational load

Evaluating some different graph based algorithms would be a start

Common network protocols in smart grids - how do they differ from conventional IT networks and other industrial networks

Focus: GNNs and reinforcement learning on datasets available to us

Is detection performance better with network based data or physical data

Sensor combination with time-series
