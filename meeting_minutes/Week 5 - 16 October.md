-lab access?
-guts stuff
-made new summary table
-not much useful stuff using epic
-found a better description of epic but didn't help (me at least) to understand data much better
-some GNN stuff
-some DL stuff (LSTM)

Options

Performance comparison of different algorithms on different datasets
Test them on detection performance
	Try and use them in a lightweight context (on a resource-constrained device)
	How can we improve performance
	Can we get them running at the edge of the network
	What is the baseline of these models performing - classical ML, neural nets

Take the best one and improve its overheads

Build up questions to empirically evaluate

FEDERATED LEARNING - offload overheads onto other devices - what part of the ML process can be done on which devices (how do you do little bits on edge devices and aggregates)
How has federated learning been used in ICS? What do these architectures look like and how can we address some of the challenges in those architectures

Come up with plan for environment + specific algorithms to evaluate
